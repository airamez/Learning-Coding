'''
- Named tuples assign meaning to each position in a tuple and allow for more readable, self-documenting code.
- They can be used wherever regular tuples are used, and they add the ability to access fields by name instead of position index.
- Named tuples are especially useful for assigning field names to result tuples returned by the csv or sqlite3 modules
