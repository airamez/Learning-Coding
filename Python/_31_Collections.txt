Introduction to collections:
It is really common in coding the requirement to store a collection or list of values.
Every programming language offer many different collection components and the most basic is called Array.
========================================================================================================================
WARNING: An Array is a collection of elements of a specific type and the size of the array is define on creation and
can't be changed later. Most of the "major" programming languages like C, C++, Java and C# offer a basic type for Array.
However, Python doesn't offer a basic type matching the classic concept of Arrays. Instead Python offers a Collection
called List that is very powerful and flexible.
========================================================================================================================

There are four basic built-in collections in Python:
List:       A list is a container that holds a number of other objects of any type, in a given order.
Tuple:      Same as a list but the elements are immutable.
Set:        A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements.
Dictionary: A dictionary is a collection of unordered values stored with a key.
